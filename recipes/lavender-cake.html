        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3><em>For the cake:</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 340F. Butter and flour three 6-inch cake 
                pans. Soak baking strips in water. (If you're making three 8" 
                layers then double the batter, three 9" layers would need triple 
                the batter.)</li>
            <li>Sift dry ingredients (including sugar). Whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine milk, culinary 
                lavender and loose black tea. Give it a quick stir. Let it simmer 
                for about 10 minutes. Strain into a bowl to cool. Measure Â½ cup for 
                the batter. Reserve the rest for the buttercream.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the wet ingredients, including butter and
                1/2 cup of the infused milk.</li>
            <li>Combine the wet and dry mixtures. Whisk until combined.</li>
            <li>Add damp baking strips to the cake pans.</li>
            <li>Evenly distribute batter into each of the pans. I like to
                use a kitchen scale for precision.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 30-35 minutes or until the centers are set and
                springy to the touch.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3><em>For the Italian Meringue Buttercream:</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat the egg whites, salt and cream of tartar, slowly add in 1/3 cup 
                of sugar and continue beating until soft peaks form.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan add the remaining sugar and 1/3 cup water then 
                place on medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Stir until sugar melts and becomes clear.</li>
            <li>Maintain at medium-high heat until temperature reads 235-240F.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the sugar into the mixer immediately.</li>
            <li>Run the mixer until meringue is cool/tepid, about 15 minutes. You can 
                pack the bowl with ice or frozen peas if you want to speed the cooling 
                down.</li>
            <li>Switch to a paddle attachment. Add room temperature butter into 
                running mixer one tablespoon piece at a time.</li>
            <li>Add the salt and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Beat until butter is combined and mixture has reached a silky 
                consistency.</li>
            <li>Distribute into multiple bowls.</li>
            <li>Use food coloring to create a gradient of colors.</li>
            <li>Transfer to piping bags. Snip off the tips of each bag.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3><em>For the American Buttercream:</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a stand mixer, cream the room temperature butter until fluffy.</li>
            <li>Sift in half of the confectioners sugar. Mix, then add the rest.</li>
            <li>Add in a few tbsps of the infused milk mixture until you reach a 
                desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Add in 2 drops of lavender essential oil. Mix until combined.</li>
            <li>Reserve about 1 cup. Add in purple food coloring. Transfer to a piping bag.</li>
            <li>Add about the same amount of white to a piping bag. Add both the white 
                and purple to one piping bag.</li>
            <li>Reserve about 1 cup for the roses. Dye with pink and orange food coloring. 
                Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a 127 tip.</li>
            <li>Dye a small amount of buttercream green for a ring, which will be the base 
                of your flower wreath.</li>
            <li>Reserve a small amount for the white daisies.</li>
            <li>Transfer the remaining white buttercream to 1 large piping bag.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3><em>For the Flowers:</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut a square of parchment paper. Use a tiny bit of buttercream to glue 
                down the paper onto a piping nail.</li>
            <li>For the roses, pipe a small cone of very thick buttercream in the middle 
                of the square.</li>
            <li>Use a 127 tip with the pointy side up to make the petals.</li>
            <li>Start with a spiral for the center.</li>
            <li>Pipe small arches for each petal, pointing the tip outward as you get 
                towards the outer petals.</li>
            <li>For the daisies, add some white buttercream to a piping bag fitted with 
                small petal tip. Pipe yellow in the center.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3><em>For the Assembly:</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pipe the purple lavender swirl between each layer.</li>
            <li>Crumb coat the cake with the plain white buttercream. Smooth with a 
                scraper and offset spatula.</li>
            <li>Starting with the darkest pink, pipe the Italian Meringue gradient.</li>
            <li>Smooth cake with a scraper.</li>
            <li>Chill the cake for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pipe a ring of green.</li>
            <li>Attach flowers to the ring and pipe leaves to fill in the gaps.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>If you're in a hurry/are not a fan of buttercream then you could make 
            this recipe as a bundt cake or mini bunts and top it with a glaze made 
            from confectioners' sugar and a few tablespoons of the lavender milk 
            tea. </p>
