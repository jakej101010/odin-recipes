        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>180g all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>227g unsalted butter (room temperature)</li>
            <li>255g creamy peanut butter</li>
            <li>165g light brown sugar</li>
            <li>150g granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla</li>
            <li>280g old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350F. Line a baking sheet with 
                parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and 
                salt.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted 
                with the paddle attachment, beat butter and peanut butter 
                on medium-low speed until smooth and well combined. Add the 
                sugars and beat on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 
                2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Beat in the eggs and vanilla on medium speed until well combined, 
                stopping to scrape down the bowl as needed.</li>
            <li>With the mixer on low, add the flour mixture, mixing just 
                until almost combined. Scrape down the bowl and add the 
                rolled oats. Mix just until combined.</li>
            <li>Scoop roughly 2 tablespoons of cookie dough onto the baking 
                sheet, placing each cookie about 2 inches apart.</li>
            <li>For gooey cookies, bake for about 12 minutes or until the 
                edges are set but the center still appears wet or shiny. For 
                crispier-edged cookies, bake for about 15 minutes or until the 
                edges and tops are lightly browned and the center is no longer 
                shiny. Let cookies cool on the pan for 5 minutes. Remove and 
                finish cooling on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure your brown sugar is soft and moist for the best 
                cookies.</li>
            <li>Don't overbake the peanut butter oat cookies, as they'll 
                continue to bake as they cool. The middle should still be 
                soft when you pull them out.</li>
            <li>Add a pinch of cinnamon for extra flavor.</li>
            <li>A room temperature egg will mix more evenly into the 
                creamed butter.</li>
            <li>Measure your flour correctly to avoid dry and dense 
                cookies.</li>   
        </ul>
